# Jest is smart about what tests it runs (by default, only runs tests related to files
# that have changed since your last commit), so it won't be too expensive to run this
# on every file change
# Make sure you have "scripts.test" configured in "package.json"
#   (this is done automatically for you in some frameworks, e.g. React)
